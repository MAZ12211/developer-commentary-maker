This is a fnf mod that lets fnf modders add their own dev commentaries to any song in their own mod
without too much setup and code.

## Features

- Works with any difficulty and variation!
This means that you can make the dev commentary from the `Easy` difficulty be different from the `Hard`.difficulty.
This is done in charters' favor to comment on (for example) their favorite charting moments in the song,
or how they placed the mines cleverly in the song to be enjoyable/satisfying for the player,
or how they handled charting multiple difficulties.

This also works for Erect remixes and playable characters' mixes that have different music and visuals!

- Image support! (optional to use)
If you have something to say about a concept art or if you want to share and talk about a remastered art vs the old one, you can!
